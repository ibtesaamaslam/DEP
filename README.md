# Spam Mail Prediction Model

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to build a spam mail prediction model using machine learning techniques. The notebook guides you through the steps of importing necessary libraries, loading and preprocessing data, training a model, and evaluating its performance.

## Overview

Email spam is a significant issue in the digital age, and machine learning can effectively address this problem by classifying emails as spam or non-spam. This project uses Python and several popular libraries to develop a spam detection model.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Load and preprocess email data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Use TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert text data into numerical features.
- **Model Training**: Train a logistic regression model to classify emails.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using accuracy metrics.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-mail-prediction-model.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd spam-mail-prediction-model
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Spam\ Mail\ Prediction\ Model.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to execute the code. The notebook is divided into sections that handle different stages of the model building process:
   - **Import Libraries**: Import necessary Python libraries.
   - **Load Data**: Load the email dataset.
   - **Preprocess Data**: Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
   - **Feature Extraction**: Extract features using TF-IDF Vectorizer.
   - **Train Model**: Train a logistic regression model.
   - **Evaluate Model**: Evaluate the trained model's performance.

## Dataset

Ensure you have the dataset file (`mail_data.csv`) in the same directory as the notebook or update the path in the notebook accordingly.
